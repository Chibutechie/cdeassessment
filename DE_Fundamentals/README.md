# Data Pipeline Design

This repository documents the conceptual design of a scalable and flexible data pipeline. It outlines the data flow from ingestion to serving, including assumptions, challenges, and guiding principles.

## Design Overview

The pipeline is designed to support multiple data sources, ingestion methods, storage layers, and serving patterns. It ensures both near real-time and batch processing needs are met, while maintaining data quality, governance, and scalability.

### Key Design Choices

- **Sources**  
  - Multiple formats: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured.  
  - Assumptions:  
    - Call center logs → batch files  
    - Social media → streaming  
    - SMS/website forms → near real-time feeds  

- **Ingestion**  
  - Supports both batch and streaming ingestion to handle frequency differences.

- **Processing and Transformation**  
  - Standardizes formats  
  - Removes duplicates  
  - Enriches with metadata  
  - Classifies complaints using keyword-based tagging or rules  

- **Storage**  
  - Layered storage approach:  
    1. Raw – original ingested data  
    2. Processed – cleaned and standardized  
    3. Curated – analytics-ready  
  - Mix of data lake and data warehouse storage  

- **Serving**  
  - Outputs feed into:  
    - Reporting dashboards  
    - Query interfaces  
    - Machine learning models (predictive insights)  

- **Orchestration and Monitoring**  
  - Daily scheduling and streaming where required  
  - Alerts for pipeline failures or delays  

- **DataOps**  
  - Controlled production environment  
  - Versioning and access control

## Assumptions

- Social media complaints come via APIs  
- Logs are captured in batch files  
- SMS and website forms stored in structured feeds  
- Organization requires:  
  - Near-real-time insights for urgent issues (e.g., network outages)  
  - Daily aggregations for reporting  
- Teams will align on standard complaint categories  

---

## Challenges and Unknowns

- Data quality variations (misspellings, incomplete complaints)  
- Unexpected spikes in social media volumes  
- Alignment across business teams on categories and metrics may take time  
- Latency expectations need clarification (how “real-time” is “real-time”?)  

---

## Additional Notes

- Design is tool-agnostic (conceptual blueprint).  
- Prioritizes scalability, flexibility, and collaboration.  
- Future iterations can map these concepts to specific technologies.
